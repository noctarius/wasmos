# Architecture Notes

This document is the architecture index and entry point for the repository.
Detailed design and implementation status now live in focused documents under
`docs/architecture/`.

IMPORTANT: Keep this file and `README.md` up to date with every prompt execution
and code iteration.
IMPORTANT: Create a git commit after each prompt iteration.
Threading design details are maintained in `docs/THREADING.md`.
Full ring-3 isolation execution planning is tracked in
`docs/RING3_ISOLATION_PLAN.md`.
Latest checkpoint: Phase 2 mapping minimization is closed for current strict
scope; Phase 5 fault-policy expansion is in progress with covered `#PF`, `#UD`,
`#GP`, and `#DE` process-local termination probes.

## Update Rules
- Update the relevant feature document(s) in `docs/architecture/` when behavior
  changes.
- Keep cross-document references consistent across `README.md`, `docs/TASKS.md`, and
  architecture docs.
- Prefer appending concrete implementation notes over vague roadmap text.
